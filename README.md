# Hi, it's Tina!
***
Initially pursuing a career as a physician assistant, I found my true calling in the field of software engineering while working as an employment specialist for a tech company. My creativity and drive as a full-stack software engineer stem from a passion for crafting visually appealing and practical solutions for clients, utilizing my front-end web design skills and back-end technical expertise. Some technologies I enjoy working with but are not limited to include React.js, JavaScript, Express.js, and Mongodb.
